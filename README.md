# Hello!
My name is darkdarcool(real name will not be disclosed), but you can call me dark!

I am a 13 year old programmer interested in game development in compilers. Currently working on DarkScript(priavate repo) and I know a couple langs.

| Languages | Skill(1-10) |
|-----------|-------------|
| Python    | 8           |
| C++       | 8           |
| Java      | 7           |
| Ruby      | 4           |
| Web DEV   | 8           | 


I am currently in middle school and code in my free time, I would like to seek a carrer in game dev or making compilers(like visual studio code)


I am trying to learn typescript, and c. I am breanching out of the console in python and making console packages(it's still different.)

I don't have any official means of you contacting me yet, but you can ping me on [replit](https://replit.com/@darkdarcool)! 

I am availible for making python packages, websites for you.

I mainly use visual studio code for my code editor, then put it on git, then replit, than the replit talk! It's the circle of code!  

I am also getting into 3-D game development on UNITY. I highly reccoment it, super good. The class I am taking is super good!
