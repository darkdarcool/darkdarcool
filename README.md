# Hello!
My name is darkdarcool(real name will not be disclosed), but you can call me dark!

I am a 13 year old programmer that's a huge nerd in math and is quirky and a dork!

I am currently a male in middle school and code in my free time.

I make stuff and I ❤️ making them! I put in a lot of effort into them and I hope you think that they are good! 

I am a mod in [@replit-coders](https://github.com/Repl-it-Coders). You can ping me over there.

## About me

I live in the heart of silicon valley, which is part of the reason why I love software so much, every second I'm probably looking at one that has been released in the last year! I even see robots going down my street! It's super cool! I hate drama, I and **EXTREMLY** introverted and **HATE** talking to people and looking them in the eye. The video games I play are: `['Splatoon 2', 'Enter and Exit the Gungeon', 'Brawl Stars(not much anymore']`. I hope you like me and my projects!
